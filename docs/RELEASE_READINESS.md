# RELEASE_READINESS

This document is the dedicated tracked source for release, install, installer, package-smoke, package metadata, install-matrix, release-artifact, and publish/deploy readiness details.

`hadara release gate --mode strict --json` may read this document and other tracked evidence, but it must remain read-only. It must not run installer scripts, package smoke, `npm pack`, install packages, publish packages, create GitHub releases, build Docker images, mutate PATH, write shell profiles, call GitHub, execute remote CI, or perform registry mutation.

## Package Metadata Release Readiness

Current bootstrap metadata mode:

- Package name decision: `hadara`.
- npm registry observation: `npm view hadara name version --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org` returned 404 on 2026-05-28; recheck immediately before publish.
- Bootstrap metadata mode: version `0.0.0-bootstrap`, `private: true`, no package publishability.
- Release-candidate metadata mode: version `0.1.0-rc.N`, `private: false`, `files` whitelist present, `LICENSE` present, package smoke evidence present.
- MIT license decision: adopt MIT; package remains private until owner-approved `LICENSE` text exists.
- Publish target decision: npm package first, GitHub Release second, Docker image deferred.

## Installer Script Surface and Schema

T-0128 defines installer and portable launcher contracts only. It does not create installer scripts, portable launchers, install trees, symlinks, shell profile edits, package copies, package artifacts, or registry mutations.

Reserved installer script paths:

- `scripts/install.sh`
- `scripts/install.ps1`

Reserved portable launcher paths:

- `portable/bin/hadara`
- `portable/bin/hadara.cmd`
- `portable/bin/hadara.ps1`

Installer responsibilities:

- Installer scripts install or plan installation from a tarball or directory.
- Installer scripts must support dry-run planning before mutation.
- Installer scripts must emit `hadara.install.plan.v1` JSON for dry-run planning.
- Installer scripts must not use `sudo` by default.
- Installer scripts must not force `npm install -g`.
- Installer scripts must not mutate shell profiles or PATH by default.
- Installer scripts must not print full environment values, npm tokens, private absolute paths, raw npm logs, or private store paths.

Portable launcher responsibilities:

- Portable launchers invoke an installed or portable HADARA bundle.
- Portable launchers do not install dependencies.
- Portable launchers do not mutate PATH.
- Portable launchers do not modify project files.
- Portable launchers must prefer the installed `hadara` command form for user-facing validation.

Default install locations:

- POSIX prefix: `~/.local/share/hadara`
- POSIX bin link: `~/.local/bin/hadara`
- Windows prefix: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HADARA`
- Windows cmd launcher: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HADARA\bin\hadara.cmd`
- Windows PowerShell launcher: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HADARA\bin\hadara.ps1`
- Windows USB portable root: `L:\HADARA`
- WSL USB portable root: `/mnt/l/HADARA`

Node and WSL checks:

- Installer plans must validate Node 22.
- Missing Node 22 must produce a friendly remediation message.
- WSL install plans must reject Windows `node.exe` shims.
- WSL install plans must require Linux Node.js.

Dry-run report schema:

- Schema id: `hadara.install.plan.v1`
- Command: `install.plan`
- Modes: `dry-run`, `execute`
- Platforms: `posix`, `windows`, `wsl`, `usb`
- Actions must describe planned writes without performing them.
- Public output must be reduced and redacted.
- Raw logs must be temporary or private/local only.

T-0128 release-gate boundary:

- The release gate checks installer surface and schema markers only.
- The release gate must not execute `scripts/install.sh`.
- The release gate must not execute `scripts/install.ps1`.
- The release gate must not create or invoke `portable/bin/hadara`.
- The release gate must not mutate install locations, PATH, shell profiles, package artifacts, GitHub Releases, Docker images, npm registry state, or user machines.
