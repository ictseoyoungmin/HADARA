# RELEASE_NOTES

## 0.2.0-rc.1

Release-candidate target after the npm-installed recycle fixes from T-0272 through T-0274 and publish-readiness refresh in T-0275.

Highlights:

- Fixes generated deterministic `run scaffold` scripts so fake-shell JSON observations match successfully.
- Hardens fresh initialized project UX for `init --json`, init doctor, status/TUI phase parsing, handoff update JSON, generic handoff suggestions, and context artifact paths.
- Improves lifecycle status clarity and mounted-workspace performance for single-task finish/read/evidence commands.
- Adds redacted failed-step diagnostics to `dev docker-check` reports while continuing to omit raw subprocess logs.
- Refreshes package metadata, README install examples, package smoke, clean-checkout smoke, release artifact, release dry-run, and publish dry-run evidence for the rc.1 source state.

Boundaries:

- Actual npm publish remains operator-gated. The intended handoff is: commit the rc.1 source/evidence state, run `npm login`, then use `scripts/release/manual-publish-rc.sh T-0275 --execute` and type the script confirmation when ready.
- GitHub Release creation remains optional and separately confirmed through the helper's `--github-draft` path.
- Docker image publishing, PyPI publishing, installer execution, and MCP release/package execution remain deferred.

## 0.2.0-rc.0

Release-candidate freeze target for Phase 6 and Phase 6.1 work. T-0269 is preparing the approval-gated npm publish path, but this version is not yet confirmed published in this workspace state.

Highlights:

- Adds workflow compression primitives for task completion, finish/ready/close, handoff suggestions, and operator-facing command reports.
- Adds multi-agent-compatible metadata foundations, including actor context fields, mutation vocabulary separation, sync-dist before-hash guarding, close evidence race recheck, and task create collision guarding.
- Refreshes package, clean-checkout, release-artifact, release dry-run, and publish dry-run evidence for the current source checkout.
- Updates README install and npx examples for the `0.2.0-rc.0` publish candidate.

Boundaries:

- This RC target does not claim full multi-agent runtime safety, lock-safe shared execution across all commands, or a complete multi-agent controller.
- Publish execution, registry mutation, GitHub Release creation, Docker image build/push, PyPI publish/token loading, and release mutation remain out of scope.
- Actual npm publish remains blocked until explicit operator approval, token presence, committed README/asset changes, fresh post-README package/release evidence, and npm registry verification.

## 0.1.0-rc.0

First npm release candidate for early CLI evaluation.
