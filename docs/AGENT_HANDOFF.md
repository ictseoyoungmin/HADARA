## Canonical Continuation State

This section is projected from `.hadara/state/current.json` so a new session can resume without reconstructing project history from scratch.

| Area | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Current Release | 0.4.6 | Portable project state. |
| Latest Completed Task | T-0642 0.5.0 task handoff identity timestamp sync | Highest Done task id, not close timestamp. |
| Latest Completed Task Basis | highest-done-task-id | Out-of-order close chronology is not tracked here. |
| Active Task | None | No active task is selected. |
| Next Work | None | Structured continuation title; not operator prose. |
| Next Work State | none | Controls whether task creation guidance is emitted. |
| Operator Guidance | No next work selected. Run `hadara task status --json` for current task-selection guidance. | Human constraints; never used as a task title. |
| Current Trusted Validation Baseline | T-0631 verified 0.4.6 stable publication and consumer recycle: npm registry returned version 0.4.6 with latest=0.4.6 and next=0.4.6-rc.1, GitHub Release v0.4.6 was published publicly, and approved installed-package recycle passed from hadara@latest expected 0.4.6. | ev:T-0631:c31dd280f6af48d6b8918b02, ev:T-0631:511bb997c92146bf8ffaf02e, ev:T-0631:598918ef009146cc95d3a0f0 |

### Current Known Problems

| Issue | State | Operator Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Task-scoped context pack is about 8-10s on the mounted WSL repository. | watch | Prefer bounded status/session paths; revisit performance only with an explicit trust/cache design. |
| Explicit live graph and context reads remain filesystem-sensitive. | watch | Warm cache first and opt into broad live diagnostics deliberately. |
| Tool-host child process launch can return EPERM while direct commands pass. | active | Run the command directly, then record it through validation run --direct-result. |
| Release artifact git-status preflight and full dev Docker workspace copy can exceed useful latency on the mounted WSL workspace. | watch | Use the clean publish ext4 worktree for release artifacts and treat the direct /workspace Docker build path as the fallback when sync-copy stalls. |

## Ownership

This document is the compact human projection for next-session continuity.
The structured canon owns the active task, next intent, live warnings, and validation baseline; completed history belongs to the Historical Index.

## Historical Index

| History Type | Path | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-P1 handoff snapshot | `docs/history/AGENT_HANDOFF_PRE_T0558.md` | Full handoff tables and historical known problems before compact ownership. |
| Pre-P1 project state snapshot | `docs/history/PROJECT_STATE_PRE_T0558.md` | Full project narrative through T-0557. |
| Documentation archive map | `docs/archive/README.md` | Locate completed specs and historical logs without default-reading them. |
| Completed task history | `docs/HANDOFF_HISTORY.md` | Older completed-task details. |
| Validation history | `docs/VALIDATION_HISTORY.md` | Older validation observations. |
| Work queue | `docs/TASK_BOARD.md` | Current status and capsule paths. |
| Task evidence | `tasks/T-*/evidence.jsonl` | Canonical per-task evidence. |
