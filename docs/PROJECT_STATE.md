## Canonical Current State

This section is projected from `.hadara/state/current.json`. Edit the structured state, then use the existing init-upgrade projection path; do not hand-edit this block.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current Release | 0.4.3 |
| Latest Completed Task | T-0565 0.4.3 non-deployment release readiness |
| Active Task | None |
| Next Operator Intent | Keep npm/GitHub publication operator-controlled; otherwise begin v0.4.4 external-repository validation planning and run post-publish recycle only after publication. |
| Validation Baseline | hadara@0.4.3: Docker 153 files / 1052 tests; installed local-tarball workflow closed-valid; artifact/package/clean-checkout smokes, strict gate, release dry-run, and docs currentness passed. |

### Current Known Problems

| Issue | State | Operator Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Task-scoped context pack is about 8-10s on the mounted WSL repository. | watch | Prefer bounded status/session paths; revisit performance only with an explicit trust/cache design. |
| Explicit live graph and context reads remain filesystem-sensitive. | watch | Warm cache first and opt into broad live diagnostics deliberately. |
| Tool-host child process launch can return EPERM while direct commands pass. | active | Run the command directly, then record it through validation run --direct-result. |
| Release artifact git-status preflight can exceed its 10-second limit on the mounted WSL workspace. | watch | Build release artifacts from a clean ext4 worktree so commit metadata and package contents remain aligned. |

## Ownership

This document is the compact human projection for product and phase context.
The six current-state facts live in `.hadara/state/current.json`; this document is not their prose source or a completed-task log.

## Product

HADARA — Local-first evidence control plane for trustworthy agentic development

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| HADARA Profile | governed |
| Branch | main |

## Current Phase

v0.4.3 source/package readiness complete without deployment; v0.4.4 external validation is next unless an operator chooses publication.

| Stage | State | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| P0 Currentness integrity | Done | Align next-work selection, active docs, and validation fixtures. |
| P1 Current-state ownership | Done | Separate compact current facts from historical narrative. |
| P2 Product compression | Done | Freeze capability growth and measure the primary workflow. |
| P3 Profile toy validation | Done | Dogfood all profiles and archive stale documents/specs; real external-repository validation remains planned for v0.4.4. |

## Current Capabilities

| Area | Current State |
|---|---|
| Task lifecycle | Status-first Task Capsules with validation evidence and guarded finalize to `closed-valid`. |
| Evidence | Canonical append-only `evidence.jsonl`, generated `EVIDENCE.md`, v2 durable ids, resolution and close proof. |
| Context | Session start, task-scoped context pack/slice, graph/code index, bounded cache-backed reads. |
| Documents | Registry/read maps, required-reading tiers, docs doctor, managed sections, safe dry-run-first patches. |
| Operations UI | Read-only Dashboard and TUI over shared read models. |
| Integrations | Read-only MCP by default; narrow approval-recorded evidence attach; Hermes context export. |
| Release | Package/clean-checkout smoke, artifact, gate, dry-run, and approval-gated publish planning. |
| Deferred | Full agent controller, real provider default execution, broad MCP writes/shell, cloud workers, private evidence encryption. |
