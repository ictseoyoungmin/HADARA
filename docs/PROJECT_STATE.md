## Canonical Current State

This section is projected from `.hadara/state/current.json`. Edit the structured state, then use the existing init-upgrade projection path; do not hand-edit this block.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current Release | 0.5.0-rc.1 |
| Latest Completed Task | T-0675 Current-State Baseline Promotion Surface |
| Latest Completed Task Basis | highest-done-task-id |
| Active Task | None |
| Next Work | None |
| Next Work State | none |
| Operator Guidance | No next work selected. Run `hadara task status --json` for current task-selection guidance. |
| Current Trusted Validation Baseline | T-0675 promoted the current-state validation baseline after focused tests, TypeScript build, docs doctor, Docker sync-build, built CLI baseline-promotion dry-run, and baseline promotion execute passed. |

### Current Known Problems

| Issue | State | Operator Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Task-scoped context pack is about 8-10s on the mounted WSL repository. | watch | Prefer bounded status/session paths; revisit performance only with an explicit trust/cache design. |
| Explicit live graph and context reads remain filesystem-sensitive. | watch | Warm cache first and opt into broad live diagnostics deliberately. |
| Tool-host child process launch can return EPERM while direct commands pass. | active | Run the command directly, then record it through validation run --direct-result. |
| Release artifact git-status preflight and full dev Docker workspace copy can exceed useful latency or fail on mounted WSL workspace-local state. | watch | Use a clean ext4 clone for release artifacts; direct /workspace artifact attempts can fail if local-only untracked state such as .claude/ is present. |
| Historical HADARA-dev package smoke timeout incidents are mitigated by isolated smokeProjectRoot and per-step timeout reporting. | watch | Package smoke/recycle now default to 300s per step for npm/recycle paths and report timeoutStepIds; use explicit `--timeout` only for a reviewed release exception. |

## Ownership

This document is the compact human projection for product and phase context.
The six current-state facts live in `.hadara/state/current.json`; this document is not their prose source or a completed-task log.

## Current Phase

v0.4.6 is published and recycled. T-0634 through T-0649 produced and published the `0.5.0-rc.0` status-ingress release candidate on npm `next`. T-0658 through T-0666 promoted the source candidate to `0.5.0-rc.1` after close-boundary hardening, continuation fixes, schema-validator `anyOf` support, and external dogfood follow-up. T-0667 recycled release readiness evidence for `0.5.0-rc.1`; T-0668 records the completed npm `next` publish, GitHub Release note artifact, and installed-package recycle from `hadara@next`. T-0669 records public GitHub Release `v0.5.0-rc.1` publication and Docker installed-package dogfood from public `hadara@next`. T-0670 begins the reviewer-requested release-readiness recycle design fixes by separating source, evidence, and disposable smoke project roots in package smoke/recycle commands. T-0671 adds journal-first release artifact evidence handling so clean source artifact preflight is not invalidated by evidence writes. T-0672 adds package smoke/recycle per-step timeout policy with a 300s npm/recycle default and timeoutStepIds for slow-stage attribution.

| Stage | State | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| P0 Currentness integrity | Done | Align next-work selection, active docs, and validation fixtures. |
| P1 Current-state ownership | Done | Separate compact current facts from historical narrative. |
| P2 Product compression | Done | Freeze capability growth and measure the primary workflow. |
| P3 Profile toy validation | Done | Dogfood all profiles and archive stale documents/specs; external/delegated validation was completed for v0.4.4. |

## Current Capabilities

| Area | Current State |
|---|---|
| Task lifecycle | Status-first Task Capsules with validation evidence and guarded task close to `closed-valid`. |
| Evidence | Canonical append-only `evidence.jsonl`, generated `EVIDENCE.md`, v2 durable ids, resolution and close proof. |
| Context | Status-first session ingress, task-scoped context pack/slice, graph/code index, bounded cache-backed reads. |
| Documents | Registry/read maps, required-reading tiers, docs doctor, managed sections, safe dry-run-first patches. |
| Operations UI | Read-only Dashboard and TUI over shared read models. |
| Integrations | Read-only MCP by default; narrow approval-recorded evidence attach; Hermes context export. |
| Release | Package/clean-checkout smoke, artifact, gate, dry-run, and approval-gated publish planning. |
| Deferred | Full agent controller, real provider default execution, broad MCP writes/shell, cloud workers, private evidence encryption. |
